description: Add a Three.js WebGL scene to a page. Use ONLY when client.md
  Stack has 3d:yes or the client explicitly requests 3D/WebGL. Do not use
  for parallax, video, or 2D canvas effects (frontend-animation,
  hero-media).

# Three.js

## Purpose
One contained, performant 3D moment - not a 3D website.

## Inputs
Stack 3d flag, design direction, performance budget.

## Outputs
A self-contained scene module in the page's script.js (or
output/shared/main.js if used on 2+ pages) + its canvas mount.

## Rules
1. Scope: ONE scene per site, in one section, lazy-initialized when the
   canvas nears the viewport (IntersectionObserver), disposed when far.
2. Budget (see "3D budget" below): renderer pixelRatio capped
   at min(devicePixelRatio,2); target 60fps on mid-range mobile; pause
   rAF when tab hidden or canvas offscreen.
3. Progressive enhancement: static poster image behind the canvas; WebGL
   unavailable or reduced-motion -> poster stands, no errors.
4. Load three via CDN with defer; guard init; version-pin the URL.
5. Assets: compressed GLB (draco if tooling available), textures <=1024px,
   total 3D payload <= 3MB.
6. Interaction limited to pointer-move parallax / slow idle rotation
   unless the client asked for more - log scope in DECISIONS.md.

## Scene setup skeleton
Init on intersection: `WebGLRenderer({antialias:true, alpha:true})`, scene,
camera (35-50 fov), debounced resize handler updating aspect + setSize with
the capped pixelRatio. Lights: hemisphere + one directional covers most
product/logo scenes. One clock owns the animation loop; all motion derives
from elapsed time (frame-rate independent). Teardown disposes geometry,
material, renderer and cancels the rAF. Keep the module factory-shaped:
`initScene(canvas) -> {destroy()}`.

## 3D budget
Draw calls < 50; triangles < 150k; texture memory < 32MB; one scene. Wrap a
lightweight FPS meter in the render loop in dev only. Sustained < 45fps on a
throttled run - cut in this order: shadows off -> pixelRatio 1.5 -> geometry
LOD -> drop the scene to the poster (yes, really: a slow scene converts worse
than a good image). Pause on `visibilitychange` hidden and when the canvas is
under 10% visible.

## Anti-patterns
- 3D as page background behind text; controls that hijack scroll.

## Changelog
- 1.1.0 scene setup + 3D budget inlined from references/ (v1.13.0)
